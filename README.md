# Advent Of Code 2022

## [Day 01: Calorie Counting](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1)

This first day was pretty easy. It was very useful to get back to using Javascript (this is what took a little bit of time: remembering how to code in js.).
I used reduce, map and sort.


## [Day 02: Rock Paper Scissors](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/2)

This day was pretty easy too. I did a very basic code that considered every possible situation with if conditions. 


## [Day 03: Rucksack Reorganization](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/3)

Very easy day once again. Nothing special to say. I could have done a better job by not repeating code for the two different parts but my goal was to simply have something that works and it does.


## [Day 04: Camp Cleanup](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/4)

I took a bad (stupid) decision on the first part on the way I stock information. I could just have done arrays and compared their values. There are better ways to solve the problem than just stocking all the number between the starting number and the ending one and looking for repetition like I did. It is not optimal but it works.

## [Day 05: ](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/5)

I really enjoyed this problem. It was pretty easy, I just used an array to stock the values and used push to add values to the stack and pop to pop the last element. For the second part, I used an intermediary array to stock the information so that it is put in the desired order in the actual stack.

## [Day 06: ](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/6)

Nothing special to say. Allowed me to used the match method. The second part is done by just changing 4 by 14.

## [Day 07: ](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/7)

Really struggled with this day. I think it is because I took a bad decision from the start. Took me a lot of time and I understood it wouldn't work. It worked on the test input data tho. The reason why it did not work is because I did not consider at first that two files could have the same name. I will try to make it work in the future.

## [Day 08: ](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/8)

First day done in GO. It was really hard to change programming language like that. I basically relearned how to do the basic things I knew how to do in JS. It took me a lot more time that if I would have done it in JS. I'll do maybe 1 or 2 more days in GO and switch back to JS for comfort and not to lose too much time each days. (learning JS already takes me a lot o time).
The problem was pretty easy, nothing much to say.

## [Day 09: ](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/9)

This is going to be my last day trying GO in Advent of Code. Indeed, it took me a lot of time to only do the first part and I did not have time to make my second part work. The first part was not that hard: I simply had to understand how the tail followed the head and defined its movement depending on the move of the head. The second part is the same thing but considering each node as the head of the following head, but I could not make it work properly and lost a lot of time. I will try to make it work completely in the future.

## [Day 10: ](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/10)

Back to JS! Pretty fun problem today. Not really hard but took a bit of time to debug and to really understand how it was supposed to work.

## [Day 11: ](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/11)

This problem was very fun and useful (especially the second part). Indeed, the first part was quite easy: it was just parsing and following the steps. For the second part, I first used BigInts but it was not enough. I then knew it was all about not having big number at lot. Dividing by the product of each test dividers seemed to be the solution.

## [Day 17: ](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/17)

I did not have time to do much AOC this week because of a lot of school work. Nonetheless, I took the time today. This day took me quite a lot of time to be honest. I always had a bug or my program always did not work for some reason(an offset to correct or other little annoying issues). In the end it worked. For the second part, the value is way too big. I did not figure out how to not stock too much information. I guess it is all about finding patterns but I could not guess the solution.
